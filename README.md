# Tech
**Node** for server-side, input-output events

**TypeScript** to finally bring some order to JavaScript, handles object/interface creation and business logic

**Express** for routing and middleware sitting on top of Node

# Purpose
This is a mockup of a **RestApi** for an ecommerce store. It is currently built with a file based
storage system, but the next step is to hook it up to a **MongoDB** and then move on to the UI.
